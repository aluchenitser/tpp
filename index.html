          <h2 class="top-h2">Branding</h2>
          <p>
            Branding is more than just a slogan or a logo. It's an idea which is unified amongst various media. Let's take your product or service
            and make it memorable not just today but for keeps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our designers and copywriters want to develop a pitch that's interesting, that works, and that was as enjoyable to make as it is for you to benefit from.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg">
          <h2>Social Media</h2>
          <p>
            Having a social media presence is a simple notion that's best executed by people
            who have a natural inclination towards playing on these platforms. It's a lifestyle.
         </p>
          <p>
            We hire these goofballs because quite simply, they know how to match your product with what's trending. That means more business for you, and more play time for us.
         </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg">
          <h2>Web</h2>
          <p>
            Yeah, TPP has a technical team. We list 'Web' last as a core competency since we know that technical matters, although often necessary,
            aren't the 'goal' of your product. You want exposure and you want to sell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our people are skilled technologists <i>and</i> skilled communicators - tough to find but worth the search. As a customer, you deserve to know what we're doing.
