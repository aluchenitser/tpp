          <p>
            Branding is more than just a slogan or a logo. It's an idea which is unified amongst various media. Let's take your idea and make it memorable not just today but for keeps.

          <h2>Social Media</h2>
          <p>
            Having a social media presence is a simple notion that's best executed by people
            who have a natural inclination towards playing on these platforms. It's a lifestyle.

            We hire these goofballs because quite simply, they know how to match your product with what's trending. That means more business for you, and more play time for&nbsp;us.

            Sure, TPP has a technical team. We also know that technical matters, although often necessary,
            aren't the 'goal' of your product. You want exposure and you want to sell.
