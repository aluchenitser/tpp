        <p class="branding">
            Branding is more than just a slogan or a logo. It's an idea which is unified amongst various media. Let's take your idea and make it memorable not just today but for keeps.
            <br><br>
            Our designers and copywriters want to develop a pitch that's interesting, that works, and that was as enjoyable to make as it is for you to benefit from.
        </p>
        <p class="social-media">
            Having a social media presence is a simple notion that's best executed by people who have a natural inclination towards playing on these platforms. It's a lifestyle.
            <br><br>
            We hire these goofballs because quite simply, they know how to match your product with what's trending. That means more business for you.
        </p>
        <p class="web">
            Sure, TPP has a technical team. We also know that technical matters, although often necessary, aren't the 'goal' of your product. You want exposure and you want to sell.
            <br><br>
            Our people are skilled technologists and skilled communicators - tough to find but worth the search. As a customer, you deserve to know what we're doing.
